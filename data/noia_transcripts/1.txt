 I'm from Austria, at least here, like Moa and Younis, there's consistency between the name and the passport. And very similar to my esteemed colleagues, I started my career in investment banking over 20 years ago, actually in 2001, at UBS in London, doing M&A and restructuring work for four years before moving on to the buy side to also work for a large US multi-strat hedge fund, managing several billion dollars and just opened a London office. I was employee number one in London and have been on the public side for the better part of the next 10 years between London and Geneva, where I'm still based right now. And I've been with Noya for the last two years now as head of research, so I work across all the four verticals and I also specifically manage liquid alternatives. So what is liquid alternatives? It's a fund of hedge funds that we've created with the idea really that we want to have a portfolio of hedge funds that have strategies that are complementary to what we cannot or do not want to do in-house. And throughout our years on the public market side, we obviously have a large network of people in the hedge fund industry and we know there's a very capable managers and strategies that are usually very niche. A lot of them are not as well known by the investors than others, but they all have very interesting attributes, most of it, that they focus on absolute returns. So this is what we're trying to do. Basically it's an actively managed portfolio of best-in-class hedge funds with uncorrelated returns. So this is very important, it's the uncorrelated part. You've seen the slide already in the next one, but I think it's very important and I have a slight different spin on it. We're taking the long run. Everyone here probably has some exposure to passive investing, equity ETFs, some bond ETFs, fixed income, and that's perfectly fine. But this exercise here shows that we've really had since 2009 especially, so from 2009 to end of 2021, actually a 60-40, which is basically just 60% S&P 500, 40% US Treasuries, has returned over 10% over that period. And in real terms, so inflation adjusts 7%. So this is pretty good and you could say if I could do this every year, I can just pack it up and we can go home. And what are we doing here? Unfortunately, it doesn't always work like this. And when you look at these last decades, what the research that this is coming from, which is from GMO, shows that they had one characteristic in common, all the gray periods, is that the starting point was elevated valuation levels. And this is the chart that you've seen previously where we are in the percentiles for the S&P 500 specifically and for NASDAQ and generally for large caps in the US is that the starting point and actually so the starting point if we say 2022, which we've gone through a correction, but then we've bounced back up, the starting point is the same. So we've seen that the S&P 500 has a very high valuation, very high valuation, very high valuation, very high valuation, very high valuation, very high valuation, very high valuation, very high valuation, very high valuation, very high valuation, very high valuation, very high valuation, very high valuation, very high valuation, very high valuation, very high valuation, very high valuation, very high valuation, very high valuation, very high valuation, very high valuation, very high valuation, very high valuation, very high valuation, very high valuation, very high valuation, very high valuation, very high valuation, very high valuation, very high valuation, very high valuation, very high valuation, very high valuation, very high valuation, very high valuation, very high valuation, very high valuation, very high valuation, very high valuation, very high valuation, very high valuation, very high valuation, very high valuation, very high valuation, very high valuation, very high valuation, very high valuation, very high valuation, very high valuation, very high valuation, very high valuation, very high valuation, very many seconds, many seconds way. That would be a lie because classic stocks are a clap up of what moment are called a from the inside. So being in the kitchen, seeing knowing how the sausage is made and usually when you see hedge fund allocators at large, private banks, wealth management platforms, pension funds, insurance companies, very often they have a checkbox, they have a very quantitative approach, they look at sharp ratios, they look at Sortino ratios, all very nice, but when they actually talk to fund manager, especially in the strategies that we're looking at, which are more mostly bottom-up fundamental strategies that we actually understand, they don't really know necessarily always how to ask the right questions and understand where does the return come from and how is the risk managed especially. So we think we have a really unique angle here that we talk to these people as our peers, a lot of these managers we've known them for a very long time, there's full transparency in terms of their portfolios, their underlying investments they have, we can discuss specific trades with them, very often we find ourselves that we have some managers that have the same trade on that we have in LFG and we can compare notes and they say oh it's really interesting because we haven't thought about that or you just had a data point that is actually validating our thesis, so which also shows that there's synergies between the different verticals that we have within NOYA Capital and that goes into thinking of why we selected these specific verticals. So the team is obviously I think our main selling point, we think this really a unique kind of starting point to be able to put together this portfolio of hedge funds and then it's really all about alignment of interests which that's the NOYA DNA, so what we're doing in-house is what we're looking for from our fund managers we like to allocate to hedge fund managers that have skin in the game that basically are all in on their own strategy and again not having like different businesses where they have some most of their their wealth allocated elsewhere or sitting on large real estate portfolio and then just trading around for fun, this is not it like all these guys are professional all in they love the game they could all retire probably some of them but they still show up every morning in the office and they want to crush it because they love the game and they love beating the markets especially and then transparency is very important for us again it's about knowing what we invest in so a lot of these funds if you don't know what you're investing in you invest based on the fact sheet and returns and can do all the dealings you want you don't really know what the investments are or you have a backward looking mirror so we really want to get transparency from managers we invest in so that we can understand their core positions how to manage the risk concentration of the portfolio and that leads to what we believe superior return profile so we are looking for strategies that are on the spectrum of higher returns than you would usually see in funder funds there's a lot of funder funds that optimize for very low volatility and there's nothing wrong with that but our DNA at Neue again is more higher returns and we're okay with some volatility although we believe that liquid alternatives by far the least volatile and the most capital protected product of any of the Neuer products but still we strive for double-digit returns so we want managers that can compound at mid teens to us and then net returns to our investors in the low teens over a period again assessed over three to five years we think worse for LFG we've had a great start and and we think we're in control of our destiny but the market can go either way with LA it's even harder to say oh well we invest in a manager and after one year we basically have to give a scorecard to everyone when we know a lot of these funds that we allocate to have very lumpy return profiles so there's some funds that will make all their money over five-year period in one year and the rest of the time they might be flat they might be down so we assess the returns again on a rolling three year three to five years is probably the appropriate time horizon for a portfolio like that to really demonstrate the skills what does no LA give an individual investor I think the the biggest point to make is actually how hard is to get access to a lot of these managers as an individual investor whether you do it through family office or ultra high net worth or you have service with a private private wealth manager it's about the selection it's really finding these niche managers that are not the necessarily the big brand names the multi managers of the world that are running billions it's about really finding them the niche managers that have this domain expertise that we're really looking for and then also being able to invest into them because a lot of these managers they have limited capacity some of the funds that were invested in are actually close to new investors but we were able to get an allocation because we have a personal relationship with the manager and he will say well all these funds always have some redemption so they will replace redemptions and we're basically first in line to be able to increase our capacity so this is really something that the product gives to us and obviously you get a diversified portfolio so we pick the names you get 15 to 20 names of the diversified exposure going through a regular selection process in depth managers evaluation and we make sure that the funds put next to each other actually a complementary so it's not only about selecting 15 funds that all we think can perform well but it's obviously and I'll go to strategies in the moment have like an all-weather fund where in any given market environment some funds and some strategies will do better than others and some strategies will outperform others would underperform and all in all the funds amongst themselves are not correlated which is very important to us again and the last thing really I think that's also very important is given our background and our beliefs at Noya we're not passive managers we're not writing a check to 15 guys and then we check in on them once a month or once a quarter and say oh you've done we've done well or you could have done better why did you do this why do you do that we everything we do is active so we obviously cannot actively trade hedge funds I like we can trade stocks but there is a lot of degree of influence you can have to rebalance certain weighting certain exposures as we get inflows every time we get inflows we have to decide whether we're going to allocate the money per all the investors or not and usually by doing that you can basically shift the portfolio according to where we believe we are currently in the market and if we see certain strategies or sub strategies that we think are there's some dislocation or a particular attractive what has been a drawdown then we can overweight those and we also on top of it have the ability to hedge the portfolio and to use futures if we feel that we're going into a really dangerous time even though we know our managers themselves they also will do their own hedging but we can still express certain views at a portfolio level and that again I think sets us apart from a lot of typical funder funds what are the core objectives of LA first of all we wouldn't be here if we didn't believe in active management so we think that it is possible to beat the market and to consistently over time not every year year in year out but measured on any longer-term time horizon we have this conviction that by picking the right strategies picking the right managers and actively managing this portfolio you can actually consistently produce equity like returns with much reduced risk which comes to lower correlation so we are looking for we think we can deliver and we're looking for performance that is uncorrelated to whatever the market does think it's important when you're in uncertain environment where you don't know where equity markets are going to go where credit markets are going to go where commodities are going to go you want basically and I'll give some examples at the end of funds you want funds that can do well in any market conditions because they're exploiting specific niches specific arbitrage strategies or they just really have a unique domain expertise in a very narrow investment universe that they focus on we seek absolute returns as I already said that compound over time so I said again the target returns that we're seeking for managers are mid teens to recycle and for the overall a product to have low teens net returns to investors after fees and expenses and what's also important it's very I'm not saying it's very easy but it's easier to get more returns obviously as you go on the liquidity spectrum if you're able if you're willing to lock up your money but LA as the name says liquid alternatives is a liquid product so we offer investors quarterly liquidity and therefore the hedge fund strategies that we invest in are all liquid so there's no private equity no private debt no mark to market no basically leftover assets and even we've been in this industry for a long time in 2008 we're all in large multi-strategy hedge funds that were all liquid but there were a lot of our peers that had gotten sucked into the wave of having a small part of their equity allocation actually turn into private equity usually how that would happen is you'd invest in the company the company gets taken private by a large LBO fund and you do the math and you say well actually they're not offering a great premium the guys were buying the company actually gonna make a killing I would actually prefer to I want actually want to be able to stay invest in the company but obviously you can't because the company is going to leave the stock market so some of the private equity funds offered the hedge funds to roll their equity into the private equity vehicle and then be locked up obviously because then you don't get an exit until the private equity fund exits and in 2008 then when when the financial crisis happened a lot of funds that had these exposures they had to basically when investors asked for their money back they said well actually 10% of your money is in this illiquid stuff but you can't get out so they had to gate redemptions they had to all sorts of things that we don't want to do so liquidity we think is really paramount and we view LA really as an all-weather vehicle where you can park your money when you don't have exciting private opportunities or higher return opportunities and that's the way we actually look at LA in-house it's an all-weather fund that will protect your capital that will hopefully give you equity like returns and that will be decently liquid that you can exit it on a quarterly basis. I'll skip a little bit over over what we're looking for but basically we look for managers that think like us that's the most important managers that share our philosophy so it's not only about picking strategies based on their returns it's really all the managers we know we have an extremely good relationship with them we have an active dialogue with them we share ideas we share idea flows we want to invest in people for the long run that were philosophically aligned with they all have skin in the game they're all in their on their business the same way we're all in on Neue and that compound at the same types of returns that we're looking for. How do we deploy the capital in LA concentration name of the game as for LFG we don't believe in managing a fund of funds with 40 or 50 names I don't think would be practical I don't think it would be necessarily adding any incremental diversification 15 to 18 funds is the sweet spot right now I think we have 16 in the fund down selected from over 200 plus funds that we review and filter on an annual basis we go deep down on on the manager evaluation and we basically then overlay on top a tactical asset allocation when we go into how we allocate the funds and this is basically how we look at the universe so we have four buckets or classified of funds and the strategies that we invest in first bucket is equity strategies self-explanatory equity long short can be long biased can be long only but usually contrarian people most of those funds actually that we're allocated to have a niche that is either geographical or they're also only invest in smaller to mid cap usually we look for the spaces they're less efficient and they usually also have a concentrate portfolio like us credit strategies this is usually opportunistic credit stress distressed and some capital structure arbitrage fairly technical we think the current environment obviously credit spreads are at all-time lows there hasn't been much distressed so it's not been the most lucrative hunting grounds but we all know that if and when there is a credit cycle or financial conditions tighten again which very well may be the case and or you just get idiosyncratic industries that get affected by political decisions there is always something to do in the credit expert and this is something that is heavily relying on legal analysis balance sheet analysis really it's it's it's it's it's it's a craft I've done myself for quite a while there's not a lot of people who really know their stuff and the managers that we invest with they're really experts in their field and it's a good balancing strategy to the equity strategies usually when the equity market doesn't do well the distress cycle is doing well macro and commodity strategies and we have also some systematic strategies in there so these are again strategies that should do well in any environment they trade rates to trade commodities futures indices and some systematic alpha strategies that I'll go into that basically just exploit market inefficiencies across different asset classes and finally event which is an area where most of us come from actually so it's a strategy that we understand extremely well those are funds that focus on companies that are undergoing transformations mergers and acquisitions selling of a division holding company trades complicated capital structures or what is an activist that came on board and this shaking up the management or the organization if you can just go back Manfred so the interesting thing all for you to know is in no LA we did what we have done at LFG as well we kept the minimum investment at the regulatory minimum that is required in Luxembourg which is a hundred thousand dollars LA is a dollar fund LFG is a euro fund so with putting a hundred thousand dollars you're basically exposed into 16 50 right now we have 16 we will be between 15 and 18 funds you will be exposed to 16 strategies that are an amalgamation within this four universes basically if you guys were to say oh no no I want to do this on my own with me as me personally with my private bank or even as my family office the the funds as someone else that wants to do that you would have to take 20 30 50 million dollars to be able to go above the minimum thresholds for those required funds and you would have to find the funds do the analysis of the 200 funds that we've looked at and then we have be able to find the funds that are actually able and accepting your capital right because as I said we have already three or four funds out of the 16 in the portfolio that are now closed that nobody else can come in basically right so this is an extremely this is really the value at that LA is giving and to every single one of you which is how we wanted to deploy our capital we seeded it and now we're accepting this if you actually think of it and you go out you put a hundred thousand dollars it's divided by 15 you're basically investing seven thousand dollar clips into hedge funds that's unheard of that's like retail level basically exposure to really really high quality managers basically right that's really what we're doing in their LA and month it will now show you a couple of examples just to make it a little bit more tangible this is a fund based in the US called MNC they're high frequency traders the fund was launched in beginning of 2024 so we're invested basically almost from day one of our fund they start with 20 million dollars they're at 150 million right now it's a team that basically comes from data science and quant approach across different asset classes have traded any market structures in the past and they returned 40% net in 2024 with only one negative month so basically being able to generate returns in any market environment and down month was down ten basis points so and this is a team that actually has been running this strategy in a previous outfit that we've basically known some of the team members when they were launching the fund we had conversations before they launched the fund we knew the track record we knew basically that they were high high quality people and so we're basically excited to back them day one with the strategy and if not extremely well and we think will continue to do well RPD is another interesting example because this is actually a sister fund so to speak of a very established long short equity fund that we also looked at run by a season equity long short manager in New York who's been doing this for 20 years with a very good track record bottom-up stock picker fundamental guy who again we've known for a while and we were particularly attracted though because the long short equity strategy was quite volatile and even though we believed it was a good stock picker we basically didn't like see the need to to add a significant amount of these equity long short managers into the fund but he basically realized that he was very good at trading options within his long short strategy and so he created a separate vehicle two years ago in February 2023 that would basically focus just on trading options on the stocks that he knows well which is basically generating income premiums or selling options every month and rolling those options on stocks that he knows well usually widely out of the money so 30% out of the money and basically saying okay I'm happy to own this stock if it goes down 30% from where it is then it's a great enterprise and that is basically a very low volatility strategy again in two years annualizing over 10% net with the worst month being down 10 basis point and this is actually a strategy where we had discussions with them who said we think the strategy is great but I would actually love because of your return profile and volatility I would love to leverage it up but I can't and so they just launched an enhanced version of the fund where they use modest leverage which we think should basically bump up the return profile from low teens to mid teens which fits very well with with our profile of strategies again uncorrelated so even though the underlying is equities in the US predominantly a lot of like S&P and Nasdaq stocks in there but in months where the Nasdaq was down five six percent this guy would be up 50 basis points 70 70 basis points so he benefits from volatility and actually the more volatility the more premium he collects from these options strategies and then finally another example of an event-driven fund and we've been in an event space for a long time and this is somebody who basically after looking at the whole space I found very few event funds that we really liked and this is a guy sitting in LA who's been doing this for 20 years or in California to be precise who's been doing merger arbitrage and event all his life has pretty much all his money in the fund started small ran it up to 750 million and he's been basically annualizing a 20% net return since 2011 with no down year but intramonth he can be volatile which puts a lot of investors off but because of our understanding of the strategy we could go in and understand okay what happened in different months is very concentrated and he has a very differentiated approach to most event-driven merger up guys who are very I would say risk averse and manage their volatility on a month-to-month basis and they cannot stomach to have a month where they're down 2% or 3% and this is basically somebody who has a very different philosophy and that's allowed him to while basically knowing what he's doing having the advantage of having a time arbitrage and saying okay I don't care about month-to-month I care about what's there at the end of the year and he's at no down year in basically 13 years and he applies an event lens to stocks that are actually not on the universe on the radar of a lot of event-driven funds which is very unique in the way it does it so these are just three examples of some strategies that that we have in the fund we usually don't disclose the names in like public documents so this is just for the purpose to make it a little bit more specific but obviously to all of our investors we're always happy to give full transparency about the managers that we allocate to and what they're doing but I hope this gave you a little bit of color and I'll get back to Mo. So I think it's the it's clear now overall that we as a firm we believe that we might be at the And therefore this is this is something that I want you guys to also think about and we obviously don't claim absolute knowledge obviously we don't know we're just you know looking at things the way we would want to run our money but this is one of the key takeaways the second one is that Noya LA actually allows you to have this diversified best-in-class exposure to these various managers which is really really difficult I don't know any other product that is out there that would give you the same I mean if there is anyone I'd be very interested to find out and then the last one is that these absolute absolute return strategies they should be in everybody's portfolio right I mean even if you have a long-term view and like you know said with the snowball effect and you say okay it does it's fine I'm gonna stay 10 10 years in the markets etc to have part of your portfolio in absolute strategies is just an enhancement of the return profile of the portfolio so it's just something that you guys should all consider and and it would be amazing if you do if you do consider that as part of being being with us on the journey I think we have a coffee break now you know things I just wanted to add just one thing I think the way I personally look at LA is is to be taken into consider into consideration with the rest of the of the scope at In the sense that I think you mentioned cash park at some point Fredo but but this is really an important aspect of our strategy in the sense that markets are not always going to be up there's not always going to be an appropriate context for the direct deal making the crypto is not always going to be the moment to add the new capital to and therefore this is the ideal strategy for us to actually park our capital which is why we insisted on having quarterly liquidity so that when the market is turning or when there's a change of paradigm whatever asset class we're referring to then we can basically pile back into those when appropriate while having those equity like returns but uncorrelated and that's really the second aspect I really want you to have to take away is I think again coming from a 10-year bull market I think we've we've starting to see a lot of volatility in the last two years and just being long equity passive or not I think it's just people have gotten probably a bit too comfortable being long equity and that's it right bonds have dropped out of portfolios real estate market has not been great and therefore people have just been accumulating more and more and more equity exposure and at some point there's a limit to that right and I personally for at least for my benefit see this is a just an alternative to just being long equity overall so I think this is this is it if it will take a will take again a couple a couple more questions so the end managers so so we the the AUM that we have we allocate right now to 16 external managers every single of those managers gives us quarterly liquidity so every three months we could say I want all my money back basically so if I've invested five million dollars into barrel I'm just making it up I could tell barrel quarterly I want my money back and they would pay me back within three months and because we have quarterly liquidity from our invest from our investments we give quarterly liquidity to our investors we ignore anybody that is above three months correct yeah that's on purpose because like like Jerome said it could be an environment and your own will go into this into the direct deal sometimes from some of our private investments we get very excited and sometimes when we get very excited you want to take outsized bets basically right and if you want to do that you need to have the be be able to take the liquidity from somewhere and that's why it think of like you want to allocate to private equity and they have a three-year allocation period and then a seven-year harvesting period so they give you your money back in ten plus two years basically but in those three years you know they will call your capital so in that period if you if you've decided you want to put ten million dollars into a private equity strategy you need to keep that ten million ready over the next three years but you don't need to be liquid like it makes no sense for you to just sit on ten million for three years to wait you could allocate it for example in LA and then know every every three six months I will start calling my capital back basically once I'm getting closer to the calling period because I need I need that liquidity to invest it elsewhere so it's like a parking lot think of it like like that exactly look for us this isn't the most exciting product right we'll get much more excited by volatility in the market of small caps crazy drawdown on crypto from one day to the other or this twist distress the direct deal buying an asset off the shelf because somebody needs to get rid of it right that's really most ninety percent of our time will dedicate to that right to two because that's what most of the value will be for no yeah but this is still an amazing product for us to be in and on top of that just if you forget about no yeah just for a second right I mean we don't have exposure to other managers outside of no yeah right I don't have any any other exposure personally to any other manager and I want to have some exposure right I don't want to be fully concentrated in our strategies I mean maybe we'll be wrong on day of course you know we will definitely be wrong at some point and this is also a hedge for us as well to some extent it's both the cash park a hedge and access to liquidity like I said right for I'll be happy to disclose I came into this year of 2025 looking at it personally thinking okay we had a we had an amazing return in markets in 2023 which followed with a bit of volatility but an amazing outcome and an amazing returns in 2024 again so nasdaq did 50% 55% in 2023 it did another 20 25% in 2024 so it's like okay we've done we've come a long way already in two years basically so I allocated personally a significant chunk to LA thinking okay I don't know what markets are going to do but I'm comfortable being with these 16 managers that give me quarterly liquidity so that if I see any change in regime and I and I want to redeploy I can then take from noya LA and I can put it into noya da or into noya LFG or elsewhere I did exactly the same one week after the US election or Trump coming into the office coming into office in January I basically sold out of all my large caps all my all my equity stakes from one day to the other and I basically pied back into this because I was just conscious of the risks and a large cash being priced to perfection and trading at 25 25 X their their their earnings gets me in a bit of a nervous position and I was basically happy to cut off that risk and try to get and try to get equity like returns true LFG but without the drawdown remember we have four different categories of managers right we have equity exposure through the equity long-short equity managers but the hope here or what we're trying to build here and this is how we build a portfolio by adding credit strategies by adding by adding macro macro managers and event driven managers we hope that when the markets will go down that the other managers the other categories outside of equities the other three will compensate for that for example we have a macro manager here that we believe in in the month of March this month where a lot of equity guys are suffering we believe they might even print double-digit returns but they'll be high single digits we just had one other macro manager that we had passed on who's already told us last week he's up 18% for the year basically right in a market that's that's down quite significantly right so this is built LA is built in a way where you have inherent hedging within the different managers and the different strategies basically right but we're not just focused on that the most important focus is that the manager itself is really good at what he's doing that's the most important
